### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* added membership program [#574](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/574)
   * To main areas of discussion 
     * name, possibly it should be “supporters” instead of members to avoid confusion 
       * no concerns from those in the meeting about renaming to “supporters”
     * whether newsletter is available for free to all or not
       * Jory - moderate readership ~100 subscribers, proposal to leave subscription settings
         for those who have subscribed, but make it a perk is good.
       * Dylan, can’t see it as perk, so would not market as perk, also don’t want to come across
         as “tiers” of info, can argue either way.
       * We have larger email list of has registered that we can use for broader communication.

  * Brian brought up question around how we’d take payments
  
* Continue CPC current board members until we get board seats sorted and new elections happen [#573](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/573)
  * Some discussion in the meeting last week that we should just do it
  * Myles brought up last time that it may need to be open for 2 weeks per the governance
    process to leave people time to object.
  * We have agreement, no further need to discuss unless somebody objects in the issue.
  * will remove from the agenda

* Incubation process clarifications [#567](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/567)
  * Next step is a proposal/PR for changes to existing process
  * Eemeli is going to do that

* Move security reporting proposal to stage 2 [#566](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/566)
  * Waiting on feedback from projects
  * Jory will send out email

* Initial draft, community board seat [#562](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/562)
  * Landed, no discussion needed.
* doc: move Collaboration network to stage 2 [#557](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/557)
  * waiting on updates from reviewers

* WIP doc: Governance changes for Collaboration Network [#547](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/547)
  * waiting on #557

* OpenJS Collaboration Network ? [#474](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/474)
  * Closed since we have PR’s to move through the proposal process

* 2nd Director seat- post July 2020 [#438](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/438)
  * Joe has action to clarify/doc based on the discussions which have taken place
    so far. Hope to have PR this week.

* Responsible security disclosures [#326](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/326)
  * PR to move proposal to stage 2 - https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/566
  * Currently waiting on getting input from projects.

* Updating the CLA to the Apache-style ICLA and CCLA [#583](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/583)
  * A number of people have agreed we should change
  * Current CLA came from JavaScript Foundation, as a custom CLA this causes more
    for companies as they need to review.  It’s better off to use a standard CLA that
    companies may have already reviewed. Apache CLA seems to be most 
    broadly used at this point.  In addition at this point given the merger, some change
    needed due to new Foundation, perfect time to change if we are going to.
  * Tobie, additional benefit. Goal is to balance IP of project for something that is
     contributor friendly. Existing CLA has same friction as Apache CLA, but has less
     protection. Better protection without any additional friction.  Second thing is that
     Apache allows people to contribute their IP or IP that they have been authorized to
     contribute on behalf of their employer. Second ask is to allow projects to choose just
     the personal CLA (versus booth) as an option.
  * Dylan CCLA’s were much harder to support than ICLA’s
