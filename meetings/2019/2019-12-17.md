## Agenda

### Announcements

*Extracted from **cross-project-council-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **openjs-foundation org** prior to the meeting.

### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* WebdriverIO: project charter review [#424](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/424)

  * Discussion about charter approval process. Decision was made to keep the process as lightweight as possible and not require a formal vote.  

* Mocha: project charter review [#419](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/419)


* Add Foundation-wide copyright guidance [#414](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/414)

Jory: had session at collab summit; wanted clarification if this PR is meant to be guide or shouldn’t change/set in stone policy
Brian: its a guide; hope its clear but can make it clearer. Changing it does not change policy. If IP policy needs to change this isn’t the place to have it, changes in IP needs to go to board. But this is a living document that can be updated and modified and a good place to work through ip policy implementation
Tobie: desire for direction for simplest implementation
Brian: seems the ask: put simple stuff at top and deeper stuff below the fold
Tobie: implementation as frictionless as possible; prescriptive about the baseline to implement
Brian: thumbs up
Tobie: I’m happy to help work through this document with you (Brian)
Tobie: Myles mentioned an FAQ which could be helpful
