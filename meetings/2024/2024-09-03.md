* Node.js is adopting an official Discord server for the Community - CoC review is needed [#1347](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1347)
Discussion of of the variations of the CoC from Node and the Foundation, and escalation, accountability to th eFoundation
Suggestion - get together with the Node team and discuss vs dictating a direction (writing can be tricky or misinterpreted without discussion).
We are trying to make life easier, but also give them some autonomy
Does the CPC got to the TSC? @joesepi will go to the next TSC (Paula volunteered to join if appropriate)

* Match repository structure to README Process and Policy section [#1345](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1345)
Lively discussion of renaming the CPC, review of Tobie’s and Chris’s drafts - 
If there are potentially simplified ways to represent the information and clarify language it’s generally viewed as a good thing (pending priorities)
@ctcpip and @tobie to provide some thoughts - Paula is happy to help or review (tag me)

* Archive the HospitalRun Project [#1307](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1307)
