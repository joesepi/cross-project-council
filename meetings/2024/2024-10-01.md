### Next week's working session

Are there any initiatives or agenda items that we should use a working session to further progress on?

Next working session we will review what is needed in documenting CoC team selection process and review the CoC action plan issue to be sure we got all the items done. If there is additional time, we will look at other smaller actionable items as well.
