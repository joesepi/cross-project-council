### Staff Updates

- https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/labels/waiting-on-legal-info
  - Discussed #1354 (DCO & CLA clarification) - Avoid ‘mandates’ in guidelines; what are the ‘approved options’ that we can support? How to avoid having every project use their own (although there are only a few realistic options). Can we provide guidance? Provide defaults that people can generally be happy with, and allow for exemptions (and provide instructions for how to ask).
