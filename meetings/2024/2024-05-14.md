### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Revisiting our policy to become a CPC member 
[#1300](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1300)
   * Michael Dawson (MD) - Can we increase the amount of time for approving requests, Robin (RG) suggested two week, which allows time for folks to attend CPC calls.  There was consensus on this time, a PR will be filed to suggest this change to the docs. 
  * Jordan Harband (JH) - Separating access from membership. In favor of anything that does not present an impediment to legitimate folks becoming involved. 
* MD suggested that perhaps nominations should be not public and follow a method similar to the travel fund process. Can we repurpose the process for the travel fund and adapt? There was consensus that this is the path forward and Ben will work with the CPC on identifying questions for the form. Ben will open an issue to push this work forward. 
  * This is where the README.md would need to be updated once we have the new nomination process - https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/tree/main#regular-members
    * The governance doc also has this which needs to be updated as it assumes nominations are done through PRs - https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/governance/GOVERNANCE.md#means-for-approvalrejection-if-citing-project-affiliation-one-of-the-following-approvals-is-required
In addition to being an Active OpenJS Collaborator, the PR to add a Regular member is approved when:
There are no outstanding objections
There are two or more approvals by voting CPC members
The PR has been opened for at least 1 week
