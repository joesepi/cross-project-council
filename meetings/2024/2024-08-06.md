### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Formalize result of CoC Team selection process [#1349](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/1349)
  * PR is open

* Document CoC Team selection process [#1297](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1297)
  * Tobie will write up something terse around this process

* Selection of new Code of Conduct Team Community Members 
[#1298](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1298)
  * This will auto close when we land the PR for the new team members

* Node.js is adopting an official Discord server for the Community - CoC review is needed [#1347](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1347)
   * Recommendation: Use Node COC 
   * Tobie: How official is this, if official it needs to use the OpenJS COC and needs to implement this as written. If this is a verified server it implies this is tied to the foundation, request clarity on this point.

* Decide on a method to archive content that is no longer current [#1346](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1346)
   * Tobie was exposed to harsh cleaning chemicals as part of this process: what do we keep and where to we put it? Cleaning up makes updates much easier. Suggest working on this during the next working session. 
   * Chris there was opposition to just deleting. Discoverability of old content is a double-edged sword, when looking you can find it, however it also can be surfaced and is out of date. Another option is to move to sep repo. 
* Michael has seen ways of indicating a document is out of date
* Tobie, ensuring old specs are not surfaced via google is a large issue for W3C

* Match repository structure to README Process and Policy section [#1345](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1345)

* Merge Working Groups and Collaboration Spaces [#1339](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/1339)

* OpenJS Github Continuity Policy [#1327](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1327)
   * Will merge today \o/

* Improve our minute taking of CPC calls [#1323](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1323)

* 2024 Foundation Project Health Survey [#1313](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1313)
* Synthesize feedback and provide report by next week - Ben

* Archive the HospitalRun Project [#1307](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1307)
