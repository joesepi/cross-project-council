LFX insights pilot on Express could be helpful
We’ve had some great discussions about how to identify / make this part of a regular rhythm
Jordan - can we come up with metrics for when we think a ‘heartbeat’ request is needed and see how our projects look
Wes - question on issue, Ben is in discussions with multi-org projects
Wes - focus on growing / supporting projects not metrics that may bring the community to jump to conclusions (‘like this project is dead’)
Michael - V1 and V2 LFX insights? Node may have looked at this so they may have feedback on experiences (lots of progress in LFX insights since the early days)
Joey - https://ismyprojectdead.com/ :)
